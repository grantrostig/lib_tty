# lib_tty

Allows for tty / keyboard / kb input on a character by character basis, also key press basis also F1 etc.

Uses C++17 (or probaly even C++11), except for one test function that demonstrates C++ Concepts and can be commented out easily.

Can be tested using this main program: https://github.com/grantrostig/file_maintenance_clipped
