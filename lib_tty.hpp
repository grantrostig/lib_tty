/** Lib_tty README (aka LT and Lt)
 *  A C++ library used to read keyboard(aka kb) / tty input from the user on a character by character basis, as single raw characters like ASCI,
 *  even when they occur within a multibyte sequence such as with kb functions keys such as F1. Noteably it is able to react to a
 *  single key press without waiting for CR or Enter or other line completion user input.  This allows the program to react immediately,
 *  in what is commonly called "raw" and or "CBREAK" mode on a terminal/tty.
 *  Uses: C++17 (mostly just C++14), except for one test function that demonstrates C++ Concepts (C++20) and can be commented out
 *  easily since it is used for debugging.
 *  Requires: termios.h (meaning: terminal input/output system call) which appears to be readily available in Fedora and other
 *  Linux variants, derived from the POSIX UNIX standard.  May also exist on Apple MAC and Windows MinGW, and maybe even Windows POSIX compatibility.
 *  Testing: can be tested manually by a programmger, using this the included main.cpp which can generate a testing program.
 *  Also testing can be manually done by an end-user, using the application program for which lib_tty was created,
 *  which is called "file maintenance" https://github.com/grantrostig/file_maintenance_clipped
 *  The Qt Creator IDE was used to edit and compile the library.  The main program is compiled using the included Makefile.
 *  This project is in early stages of development, but does seem to work.
 *  Except it seems to keep raw mode even after stty sane was restored between each get_kb_keys_raw() call.
